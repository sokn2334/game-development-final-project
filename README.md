# Game Development - Final Project

## Title: Umbra

Umbra is a game where you play as a shadow that can only exist in darkness. Your goal is to avoid the light as well as enemies that appear in the dungeon. Use the arrow keys and mouse to navigate around the lights.

## Inspiration
#### SCHiM

This is my main inspiration for this game and is very similar to the one I would like to create. I like how the player can jump from shadow to shadow in SCHiM, however, I want to have the main game mechanic being the control of the light.

#### Shadows

This game has a similar vibe to the one that I would like to create. I like the color palette and the creatures in this game.
